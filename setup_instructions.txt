# Drone Survey Management System - Setup Instructions

This guide provides the steps to set up the development environment for the project on Windows.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or newer (You have 3.8.0)
- Node.js and npm (LTS version recommended)
- MySQL Server

---

## 1. Backend Setup (FastAPI)

1. **Navigate to the project root directory:**
   ```sh
   cd flytbase_drone_assignment
   ```

2. **Create the backend directory (if it doesn't exist):**
   ```sh
   mkdir backend
   cd backend
   ```

3. **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
   ```sh
   python -m venv venv
   .\venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
   *Your terminal prompt should now be prefixed with `(venv)`.*

4. **Install Python dependencies:**
   *A `requirements.txt` file will be created for you. Run the following command to install the necessary packages:*
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. **Configure Database Connection:**
   *The application will require connection details for your MySQL server (host, user, password, database name). This will be configured within the FastAPI application code later.*

## 2. Frontend Setup (React + TypeScript)

1. **Navigate to the project root directory.**

2. **Create the React application:**
   *From the root directory, run the following command. This will create a `frontend` folder with the React project.*
   ```sh
   npx create-react-app frontend --template typescript
   ```

3. **Navigate into the frontend directory:**
   ```sh
   cd frontend
   ```

4. **Install additional frontend dependencies:**
   ```sh
   npm install axios react-router-dom leaflet react-leaflet
   npm install @types/leaflet @types/react-leaflet --save-dev
   ```

## 3. Running the Application

*Instructions for running the backend server and frontend development server will be provided once the initial code is in place.*
